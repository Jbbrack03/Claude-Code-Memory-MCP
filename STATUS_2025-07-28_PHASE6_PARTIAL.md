# Implementation Status - 2025-07-28

## Phase 6: Production Hardening - Partial Completion

### Summary
Completed several critical Phase 6 Production Hardening features including scalable vector indexing, rate limiting, git remote tracking, and code quality improvements. All tests are passing (472 total).

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Test Status Check and Fixes
- Fixed failing test in rate-limiter.test.ts (unused import)
- All 472 tests now passing (100% pass rate)

#### 2. Scalable Vector Index Implementation
- Integrated existing ScalableVectorIndexImpl with VectorStore
- Added `useScalableIndex` configuration option
- Uses hnswlib-node for O(log n) search performance
- Seamless fallback to SimpleVectorIndex when disabled

#### 3. Rate Limiting Implementation
- Created comprehensive RateLimiter class from scratch
- Features:
  - Sliding and fixed window modes
  - TTL support for automatic cleanup
  - Per-identifier tracking
  - State inspection and manual reset
- All 27 rate limiter tests passing

#### 4. Git Remote Tracking
- Added `getRemoteTrackingInfo()` method to GitMonitor
- Returns ahead/behind counts for current branch
- Handles cases with no remote tracking gracefully
- Comprehensive test coverage (6 tests)

#### 5. Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed error message formatting in context-builder.ts
- Added `close()` method to CircuitBreaker for timer cleanup
- Updated HookSystem to call `circuitBreaker.close()` on shutdown
- Prevents test resource leaks and ensures clean process exit

### Test Coverage
- Total tests: 472 (increased from 433)
- All tests passing
- New test files:
  - tests/git/git-remote-tracking.test.ts
  - tests/utils/rate-limiter.test.ts (existing but fixed)

### Files Modified
- src/storage/vector-store.ts - Scalable index integration
- src/utils/rate-limiter.ts - Complete implementation
- src/git/monitor.ts - Remote tracking functionality
- src/intelligence/context-builder.ts - Error message fix
- src/hooks/circuit-breaker.ts - Added close() method
- src/hooks/system.ts - Added circuitBreaker.close() call
- CLAUDE.md - Updated with latest progress

### Next Steps
Remaining Phase 6 tasks from IMPLEMENTATION.md:
- [ ] Configuration hot reloading
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Graceful degradation strategies
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring
- [ ] Backup and restore functionality

### Technical Decisions
1. **Scalable Vector Index**: Leveraged existing hnswlib-node implementation rather than creating new one
2. **Rate Limiter**: Built flexible implementation supporting both sliding and fixed windows
3. **Git Remote Tracking**: Used git rev-list commands for accurate ahead/behind counts
4. **Resource Cleanup**: Systematic approach to timer cleanup prevents test hangs

### Quality Metrics
- Zero failing tests
- Comprehensive test coverage for new features
- Clean TypeScript compilation
- Proper resource cleanup implemented
