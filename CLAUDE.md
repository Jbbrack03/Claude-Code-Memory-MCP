```

### Code Quality
```bash
npm run lint             # Run ESLint

```
When implementing new features:
1. Use test-architect to plan the test strategy
2. Use test-writer to create failing tests
3. Use implementation-verifier to write minimal passing code
4. Use refactoring-specialist to improve the code
5. Use test-coverage-analyst to verify coverage
6. Use test-quality-auditor for final review

## Architecture Overview

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides persistent memory for Claude Code sessions. The system captures verified events through hooks, stores them with semantic indexing, and injects relevant context when needed.

### Core Architecture Principles
- **Defensive Programming**: Every operation assumes potential failure. All subsystems have initialization checks, error boundaries, and graceful degradation.
- **Workspace Isolation**: Complete separation between projects - no shared state or cross-contamination.
- **Transactional Integrity**: SQLite with WAL mode ensures ACID compliance. All multi-step operations use transactions.
- **Verified Data Only**: Memory comes only from hook-verified events, preventing hallucination corruption.

### System Components

The server consists of five main subsystems initialized in `src/server/index.ts`:

1. **Storage Engine** (`src/storage/engine.ts`)
   - Multi-layer storage: SQLite for structured data, vector DB for embeddings, file system for large content
   - Handles memory capture, retrieval, and statistics
   - Enforces size limits and workspace isolation

2. **Hook System** (`src/hooks/system.ts`)
   - Executes Claude Code hooks in sandboxed environment
   - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures
   - Resource limits: timeout, memory, CPU

3. **Git Integration** (`src/git/integration.ts`)
   - Tracks repository state and branch changes
   - Validates memories against Git truth
   - Branch-specific memory isolation

4. **Intelligence Layer** (`src/intelligence/layer.ts`)
   - Generates embeddings using local models (@xenova/transformers)
   - Semantic search and context building
   - Caching and batch processing

5. **MCP Server Core** (`src/server/index.ts`)
   - Implements MCP protocol with tools and resources
   - StdioServerTransport for Claude Code communication
   - Graceful shutdown handling

6. **Test Infrastructure** (`tests/utils/`)
   - Timeout-aware test helpers with resource cleanup
   - Test cleanup manager for resource lifecycle tracking
   - Enhanced mocks preventing hanging operations
   - Automated coverage generation and pre-commit hooks

### Data Flow
1. Claude Code triggers hook → Hook System captures event
2. Storage Engine validates and stores memory with embeddings
3. On tool use, Intelligence Layer retrieves relevant memories
4. Context injection happens through MCP protocol

### Key Implementation Details
- All imports use `.js` extensions for ESM compatibility
- Zod schemas validate all external inputs
- Winston logger with module-specific child loggers
- Config loaded from environment with defaults (`src/config/index.ts`)

## Testing Approach

Tests follow TDD pattern with Given/When/Then structure:
- Unit tests for each subsystem in `tests/`
- Integration tests for subsystem interactions
- E2E tests for complete workflows
- 80% coverage threshold enforced

Jest configured for ESM with ts-jest. Tests use `.test.ts` extension.

## Performance Requirements
- Hook execution: < 500ms (p95)
- Memory storage: < 100ms (p95)  
- Query response: < 200ms (p95)
- Context injection: < 200ms (p95)

## Security Considerations
- Hooks run in sandboxed environment with resource limits
- Advanced command injection prevention with pattern detection:
  - Command chaining (`;`, `&&`, `||`)
  - Pipe operations (`|`)
  - Redirections (`>`, `<`)
  - Command substitution (`` ` ``, `$()`)
  - Newline injection
- Sensitive data detection and redaction
- No storage of credentials or secrets
- Environment variable isolation in hook execution
- Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
