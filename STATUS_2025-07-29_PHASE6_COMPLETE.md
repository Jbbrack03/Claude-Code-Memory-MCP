### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

#### Rate Limiting Integration:
```typescript
// MCP server handlers now include rate limiting
const captureMemoryLimiter = new RateLimiter({
  maxRequests: 100,
  windowMs: 60000,
  keyPrefix: 'capture-memory',
  slidingWindow: true
});

const { allowed, retryAfter } = await captureMemoryLimiter.checkLimit(sessionId);
```

#### Vector Similarity Integration:
```typescript
// Storage engine supports semantic queries
const results = await storage.queryMemories({
  semanticQuery: 'user authentication security',
  limit: 10,
  workspaceId: 'project-a'
});
```

#### Scalable Vector Index:
```typescript
// O(log n) search performance with hnswlib-node
const index = new ScalableVectorIndexImpl({ 
  dimension: 384,
  maxElements: 10000,
  M: 16,
  efConstruction: 200 
});
```

### 📈 Performance Benchmarks
