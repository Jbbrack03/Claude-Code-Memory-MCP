## Implementation Requirements

Based on the failing tests, the following implementations are required:

### Required Files:

1. **`tests/utils/test-helpers.ts`**
   - `withTimeout(promise, timeoutMs, operationName?, cleanupManager?)` function
   - Integration with cleanup manager for resource tracking
   - Proper timeout error messages
   - Timer cleanup to prevent memory leaks

2. **Enhanced `tests/setup.ts`**
   - `setupTestEnvironment(config?)` function
   - `teardownTestEnvironment()` function
   - `getTestCleanupManager()` function
   - `registerTestResource(id, type, cleanupFn?)` function
   - `cleanupTestResources(type?)` function
   - `setupTestTimeout(timeout?, handler?)` function
   - Environment isolation and Jest integration

3. **`tests/utils/test-cleanup-manager.ts`**
   - `TestCleanupManager` class
   - `ResourceType` enum ('database', 'file', 'network', 'memory', 'custom')
   - `CleanupResource` interface
   - `CleanupOptions` interface
   - `ResourceLifecycleHooks` interface
   - Resource tracking and cleanup functionality
   - Timeout resource management
   - Concurrent operation support

4. **`tests/utils/test-utilities.ts`**
   - `createTestDatabase(config)` function
   - `createTempFile(content, options)` function
   - `createMockNetworkCall(config)` function
   - `waitForCondition(condition, options)` function
   - `retryOperation(operation, options)` function
   - `generateTestData(schema, options?)` function
   - `TestUtilities` class for integrated usage

## Test Execution Status

All test suites are currently **failing** as expected in the TDD red phase:

```bash
# Current test execution results:
FAIL tests/utils/test-helpers.test.ts - Module not found
FAIL tests/setup.test.ts - Export not found
FAIL tests/utils/test-cleanup-manager.test.ts - Module not found  
FAIL tests/utils/test-utilities.test.ts - Module not found
FAIL tests/integration/timeout-helpers-integration.test.ts - Module not found
```

## Test Quality Validation

### FIRST Principles Compliance:
- **Fast**: Tests use mocked timers and avoid real delays
- **Independent**: Each test can run in isolation with proper setup/teardown
- **Repeatable**: Tests use deterministic mocking and avoid external dependencies
- **Self-validating**: Clear assertions with descriptive error messages
- **Timely**: Tests written before implementation (TDD red phase)

### Coverage Areas:
- **Edge Cases**: Zero/negative timeouts, large values, invalid inputs
- **Error Conditions**: Cleanup failures, resource exhaustion, circular dependencies
- **Concurrency**: Multiple simultaneous operations, race conditions
- **Performance**: Memory leaks, scalability under load
- **Integration**: Real-world async operations, Jest lifecycle integration

## Next Steps

1. **Implement `withTimeout` function** with comprehensive timeout handling
2. **Enhance test setup infrastructure** with resource tracking
3. **Create TestCleanupManager class** with full lifecycle management
4. **Build test utilities** for database, file, and network operations
5. **Verify integration** across all components
6. **Validate performance** under concurrent load
7. **Run full test suite** to confirm green phase achievement

## Success Criteria

Implementation will be considered complete when:
- All 428 timeout helper tests pass
- No memory leaks in timeout operations
- Resource cleanup is guaranteed even on failures
- Performance requirements are met (sub-500ms operations)
- Integration with Jest lifecycle is seamless
- Error handling is comprehensive and helpful

This comprehensive test suite ensures that the timeout helpers implementation will be robust, performant, and production-ready for the Claude Code Memory MCP Server.
