# Implementation Status - Claude Code Memory MCP Server

Date: 2025-07-25 08:40
Session: Phase 2 Completed

## Progress Summary

### Phase 1: Storage Engine Foundation - COMPLETE âœ…
- âœ… SQLite storage implementation complete with tests
- âœ… Vector store implementation complete with tests (17 tests passing)
- âœ… File store implementation complete with tests (18 tests passing)
- âœ… Storage engine integration complete
- **All Phase 1 tests passing**

### Phase 2: Hook System Implementation - COMPLETE âœ…
- âœ… HookExecutor implementation complete (17 tests passing)
  - Command sandboxing with allowlist
  - Environment variable isolation
  - Timeout enforcement
  - Working directory control
  - Command injection prevention
- âœ… CircuitBreaker implementation complete (15 tests passing)
  - Per-operation circuit tracking
  - State transitions (closed â†’ open â†’ half-open â†’ closed)
  - Concurrent request handling with pending count
  - Statistics tracking (total vs consecutive failures)
  - Configurable thresholds and timeouts
- âœ… HookSystem integration complete (13 tests passing)
  - Integrated HookExecutor and CircuitBreaker
  - Hook registration and pattern matching
  - Environment variable injection
  - JSON output parsing support
  - Multiple hook execution
  - Sensitive data filtering
  - Non-zero exit code handling for circuit breaker
- **All 45 Hook System tests passing**

### Key Technical Achievements This Session
1. Implemented complete TDD approach for all components
2. Fixed complex concurrency issues in CircuitBreaker
3. Proper error handling and circuit breaker integration
4. Clean separation of concerns between components
5. Comprehensive test coverage with edge cases

### Test Summary
```
Phase 1 - Storage:
- SQLite: âœ… All tests passing
- Vector Store: âœ… 17/17 tests
- File Store: âœ… 18/18 tests
- Storage Engine: âœ… All tests passing

Phase 2 - Hook System:
- HookExecutor: âœ… 17/17 tests
- CircuitBreaker: âœ… 15/15 tests  
- HookSystem: âœ… 13/13 tests
Total Phase 2: âœ… 45/45 tests

Overall: All tests passing! ðŸŽ‰
```

### Architecture Notes
- HookSystem uses a flexible HookConfig interface separate from main Config
- CircuitBreaker tracks both total and consecutive failures
- HookExecutor provides robust command sandboxing
- All components follow defensive programming principles
- Proper cleanup and resource management throughout

### Next Steps - Phase 3: Git Integration
According to IMPLEMENTATION.md, Phase 3 includes:
1. Git State Monitor
2. Branch Change Detection
3. Memory Validation

### Technical Debt & Improvements
- Jest warning about open handles (timers in CircuitBreaker) - minor issue
- Could add more sophisticated command parsing in HookExecutor
- Circuit breaker statistics could be persisted

## Session Summary
Successfully completed Phase 2 of the Claude Code Memory MCP Server implementation. All hook system components are fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage. The system is ready for Phase 3: Git Integration.
