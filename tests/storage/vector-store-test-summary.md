# VectorStore Enhancement Tests - TDD Red Phase

This document summarizes the comprehensive failing tests created for VectorStore enhancements. All tests are currently in the RED phase of TDD, failing because the features are not yet implemented.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `vector-store-similarity.test.ts`
Tests for cosine similarity calculations and alternative distance metrics.

**Key Features to Implement:**
- Proper cosine similarity calculation for all vector pairs
- Support for alternative metrics (`angular`, `euclidean`)
- Handling of edge cases (zero vectors, opposite vectors)
- Performance optimization for high-dimensional vectors
- Sparse vector optimization

**Failing Tests:**
- Cosine similarity calculations for orthogonal, parallel, and opposite vectors
- Zero-magnitude vector handling
- Vector normalization
- Ranking by similarity scores
- Angular and Euclidean distance metrics
- High-dimensional vector performance
- Sparse vector optimization

### 2. `vector-store-embeddings.test.ts`
Tests for EmbeddingGenerator integration and text-based operations.

**Key Features to Implement:**
- `storeText()` method for automatic embedding generation
- `searchText()` method for text-based semantic search
- `storeTextBatch()` for efficient batch text storage
- `hybridSearch()` combining vector and metadata filtering
- Cross-encoder re-ranking support
- Multiple embedding model support
- Embedding caching and batch optimization

**Failing Tests:**
- Automatic embedding generation when storing text
- Semantic search with text queries
- Batch text storage with embedding generation
- Hybrid search with weighted scoring
- Cross-encoder re-ranking
- Multiple embedding models
- Dimension mismatch handling
- Concurrent embedding request batching

### 3. `vector-store-batch.test.ts`
Tests for batch operations on vectors.

**Key Features to Implement:**
- `storeBatch()` for bulk vector insertion
- `upsertBatch()` for update-or-insert operations
- `getBatch()` for bulk retrieval by IDs
- `getBatchByFilter()` for filtered bulk retrieval
- `deleteBatch()` for bulk deletion
- `deleteByFilter()` for filtered deletion
- `searchBatch()` for multiple concurrent searches
- Transactional batch operations
- Progress callbacks for long operations

**Failing Tests:**
- Bulk vector insertion with validation
- Large batch performance (10,000+ vectors)
- Upsert operations with conflict resolution
- Batch retrieval with missing ID handling
- Filtered batch operations
- Pagination support
- Atomic batch operations with rollback
- Concurrent batch search optimization

### 4. `vector-store-filtering.test.ts`
Tests for advanced metadata filtering capabilities.

**Key Features to Implement:**
- Range queries (`$gte`, `$lt`, etc.)
- IN queries (`$in` operator)
- NOT queries (`$ne`, `$not`)
- OR/AND logical operators
- Nested query conditions
- Regex pattern matching (`$regex`)
- Exists/not exists queries (`$exists`)
- Metadata indexing for performance
- Filter caching
- Dynamic function-based filters
- Computed fields in filters

**Failing Tests:**
- Complex query operators
- Nested logical conditions
- Pattern matching
- Field existence checks
- Metadata index usage
- Filter optimization
- Filter result caching
- Cache invalidation
- Filter usage statistics

### 5. `vector-store-performance.test.ts`
Tests for performance requirements and edge cases.

**Key Features to Implement:**
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Memory optimization modes
- Concurrent operation safety
- Health monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Backup and restore functionality
- Graceful error handling
- Recovery from corruption

**Failing Tests:**
- Search latency < 200ms (p95)
- High insertion rates (500+ vectors/second)
- Concurrent search handling
- Memory usage optimization
- Edge cases (NaN, Infinity, duplicates)
- Corrupted index recovery
- File system error handling
- Performance metrics collection
- Health checks and monitoring

## Implementation Priority

Based on the test coverage, the recommended implementation order is:

1. **Core Enhancements** (vector-store-similarity.test.ts)
   - Fix cosine similarity calculation
   - Add support for different distance metrics
   - Handle edge cases properly

2. **Batch Operations** (vector-store-batch.test.ts)
   - Implement storeBatch() and getBatch()
   - Add upsertBatch() functionality
   - Implement deleteBatch() operations

3. **Advanced Filtering** (vector-store-filtering.test.ts)
   - Add query operators ($gte, $in, $or, etc.)
   - Implement metadata indexing
   - Add filter caching

4. **Embedding Integration** (vector-store-embeddings.test.ts)
   - Add storeText() and searchText() methods
   - Integrate with EmbeddingGenerator
   - Implement batch text operations

5. **Performance & Monitoring** (vector-store-performance.test.ts)
   - Add performance metrics
   - Implement health monitoring
   - Add backup/restore functionality

## Test Execution

To run specific test suites:

```bash
# Run individual test files
npm test tests/storage/vector-store-similarity.test.ts
npm test tests/storage/vector-store-embeddings.test.ts
npm test tests/storage/vector-store-batch.test.ts
npm test tests/storage/vector-store-filtering.test.ts
npm test tests/storage/vector-store-performance.test.ts

# Run all vector store tests
npm test tests/storage/vector-store*.test.ts
```

Currently, all tests will fail with TypeScript compilation errors and missing method errors, which is expected in the TDD red phase.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the missing methods and features in `src/storage/vector-store.ts`
2. Update the `VectorConfig` interface to include new configuration options
3. Add the necessary dependencies and helper classes
4. Make tests pass one by one, following TDD principles
5. Refactor and optimize after tests are green
