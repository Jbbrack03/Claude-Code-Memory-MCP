# Implementation Status - Claude Code Memory MCP Server

Session: Continuing from previous conversation

## Progress Summary

### Phase 1: Storage Engine Foundation - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ SQLite storage implementation complete with tests
- ‚úÖ Vector store implementation complete with tests (17 tests passing)
- ‚úÖ File store implementation complete with tests (18 tests passing)
- ‚úÖ Storage engine integration complete

### Phase 2: Hook System Implementation - IN PROGRESS üöß
- ‚úÖ HookExecutor implementation complete (17 tests passing)
  - Command sandboxing with allowlist
  - Environment variable isolation
  - Timeout enforcement
  - Working directory control
  - Command injection prevention
- ‚úÖ CircuitBreaker implementation complete (15 tests passing)
  - Per-operation circuit tracking
  - State transitions (closed ‚Üí open ‚Üí half-open ‚Üí closed)
  - Concurrent request handling with pending count
  - Statistics tracking (total vs consecutive failures)
  - Configurable thresholds and timeouts
- üöß HookSystem integration - Tests written, implementation needed
  - Need to integrate HookExecutor and CircuitBreaker
  - Need to implement hook registration and matching
  - Need to handle hook configuration format

### Key Issues Fixed This Session
1. FileStore checksum verification not throwing errors - Fixed by re-throwing integrity errors
2. HookExecutor command parsing too restrictive - Updated to check injection patterns only outside quotes
3. Node command not found when PATH overridden - Modified to include process.env.PATH
4. CircuitBreaker concurrent operations exceeding threshold - Added pending request tracking
5. CircuitBreaker statistics test expecting cumulative failures - Separated consecutive vs total failures

### Next Steps
1. Implement HookSystem integration with HookExecutor and CircuitBreaker
2. Define proper hook configuration structure (separate from Config["hooks"])
3. Complete Phase 2 by implementing hook registration and matching logic
4. Move to Phase 3: Git Integration

### Technical Notes
- All imports use `.js` extensions for ESM compatibility
- Jest configured with ts-jest for TypeScript support
- Tests follow Given/When/Then pattern
- 80% coverage threshold enforced
- Winston logger used throughout with module-specific child loggers

### Test Status
```
Phase 1 Tests: ‚úÖ All passing
- SQLite: ‚úÖ 
- Vector Store: ‚úÖ 17/17 tests
- File Store: ‚úÖ 18/18 tests
- Storage Engine: ‚úÖ

Phase 2 Tests:
- HookExecutor: ‚úÖ 17/17 tests
- CircuitBreaker: ‚úÖ 15/15 tests
- HookSystem: ‚ùå 0/X tests (TypeScript errors - need implementation)
